# Matrix Multiplication

## Introduction
This is an application that performs matrix multiplication based on user input. It demonstrates matrix manipulation and multiplication. It is a practical exercise in handling two-dimensional arrays and mathematical operations in Java.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns, and elements of two matrices, A and B.
- Provides error handling for non-integer inputs and dimension mismatches.
- Displays input matrices A and B.
- Computes and displays the resulting matrix C after performing the multiplication. 

## Concept
When multiplying a matrix A of dimensions (n, m) with a matrix B of dimensions (m, p) , we obtain a matrix C of dimensions (n, p) :     A(n,m) * B(m,p) = C(n,p)
Matrix multiplication is performed by multiplying the components of the two matrices row by column.
